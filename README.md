# Sessionizer

Quick access to existing project directories in your preferred editor.

## Usage
- Search for a project and open it in your preferred editor.
- If the directory doesn't exist, create it and open it on the fly.

## Configure Extension

Sessionizer allows you to customize:

- Projects Directory Path - This is the root directory where all your projects are stored.
- Projects Directory Levels - This defaults to 1, which assumes all your projects are stored directly in the directory selected above. If you group your projects in subdirectories (e.g., Work, Personal, Others, etc.), you will want to set this to 2.
- Preferred Editor - This is the code editor you want to use to open your projects.
