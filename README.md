# Sessionizer

Quick access to existing project directories in your preferred editor.

## Usage
- Search for a project and choose from multiple editors to open it with.
- If the directory doesn't exist, create it and open it on the fly.
- Switch between different editors on the fly for each project.

## Features
- **Multi-editor support**: Choose from multiple editors including VS Code, Cursor, Vim, Neovim, Sublime Text, WebStorm, and your configured preferred editor
- **On-the-fly editor selection**: No need to configure a single editor - pick the right tool for each project
- **Dynamic actions panel**: Each project shows all available editor options with appropriate icons

## Configure Extension

Sessionizer allows you to customize:

- Projects Directory Path - This is the root directory where all your projects are stored.
- Projects Directory Levels - This defaults to 1, which assumes all your projects are stored directly in the directory selected above. If you group your projects in subdirectories (e.g., Work, Personal, Others, etc.), you will want to set this to 2.
- Preferred Editor - This is the code editor you want to use to open your projects.
